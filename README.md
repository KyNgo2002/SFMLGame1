# SFMLGame1
First game made with SFML graphics libraries


This repository contains my first "project" working with the SFML graphics library. This project was undertaken for mainly educative purposes
so that I could learn SFML for another project I had in mind. This project is therefore partially incomplete, but will likely not be revisited.


Credit to this project is due to Shuraj Sharma for the amazing SFML tutorial series, from which most of this project was derived.
